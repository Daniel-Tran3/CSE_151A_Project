## Project Objective
In this project, we will be exploring an apartment rental dataset and building a model to predict rental prices.

### Preprocessing Approach
We want to ensure the integrity of our data, in order to achieve a high level of accuracy when modelling. These are some of the steps we have taken:

**Handling Missing Values**\
We addressed missing values by filling categorical fields like amenities and pets_allowed with "None" or a similar placeholder. For numeric fields such as bathrooms and bedrooms, we used the median to fill in the gaps, preserving the data distribution.

**Feature Engineering**\
We transformed the amenities field into multiple binary columns, each indicating the presence or absence of specific amenities. This approach allows a more detailed analysis of amenities' effects on rentals.

**Encoding Categorical Variables**\
In order to simplify our dataset, categorical variables including currency and price_type have be converted to one-hot encoded vectors, eliminating the introduction of arbitrary numeric relationships. This ensures a clearer relationship and conclusion.

**Normalization**\
Numeric fields like price and square_feet will be normalized to ensure uniformity in scale across our dataset, which is crucial for our models' performance.

**Outlier Management**\
We carefully examine price and square_feet for outliers, choosing to cap or remove them based on their severity and impact on the dataset. 

**Text Data Preprocessing**\
For textual data in title and body, we plan to clean up by removing special characters and standardizing text cases, setting the stage for potential text analysis and feature extraction.

**Data Types Correction**\
Ensuring all columns are of the correct data type is a priority, including accurately converting boolean fields and validating the consistency of numerical fields.

This preprocessing strategy ensures our dataset is primed for analysis and detailed exploration (including modeling), focusing on cleanliness, structure, and readiness for in-depth exploration. It lays the groundwork for robust and insightful data-driven models and findings.
